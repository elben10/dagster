# Serverless deployment in Dagster Cloud

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Dagster Cloud Serverless is a fully managed version of Dagster Cloud, and is the easiest way to get started with Dagster. With Serverless, you can run your Dagster jobs without spinning up any infrastructure.

---

## When to choose Serverless

Serverless works best with workloads that primarily orchestrate other services or perform light computation. Most workloads fit into this category, especially those that orchestrate third-party SaaS products like cloud data warehouses and ETL tools.

If any of the following are applicable, you should select [Hybrid deployment](/dagster-cloud/deployment/hybrid):

- You require substantial computational resources. For example, training a large machine learning (ML) model in-process.
- Your dataset is too large to fit in memory. For example, training a large machine learning (ML) model in-process on a terabyte of data.
- You need to distribute computation across many nodes for a single run. Dagster Cloud runs currently execute on a single node with 4 CPUs.
- You don't want to add Elementl as a data processor.

---

## Limitations

Serverless is currently in early access and is subject to the following limitations:

- Maximum of 100 GB of bandwidth per day
- Maximum of 4500 step-minutes per day
- Runs receive 4 vCPU cores, 16 GB of RAM and 128 GB of ephemeral disk
- Sensors receive 0.25 vCPU cores and 512 MB of RAM
- The Serverless base image is `debian:bullseye-slim`. Custom Dockerfiles are not currently supported.
- All Serverless jobs run in the United States

Enterprise customers may request a quota increase by [contacting Sales](mailto:sales@elementl.com).

## Getting started with Serverless

- [With GitHub](#with-github)
- [Without GitHub (GitLab, BitBucket, or local development)](#without-github-gitlab-bitbucket-or-local-development)
- [Adding secrets](#adding-secrets)

### With GitHub

If you are a GitHub user, our GitHub integration is the fastest way to get started. It uses a GitHub app and GitHub Actions to set up a repo containing skeleton code and configuration consistent with Dagster Cloud's best practices with a single click.

When you create a new Dagster Cloud organization, you'll be prompted to choose Serverless or Hybrid deployment. Once activated, our GitHub integration will scaffold a new git repo for you with Serverless and Branch Deployments already configured. Pushing to the `main` branch will deploy to your `prod` Serverless deployment. Pull requests will spin up ephemeral [branch deployments](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments) using the Serverless agent.

### Without GitHub (GitLab, BitBucket, or local development)

If you don't want to use our GitHub integration, we offer a powerful CLI that you can use in another CI environment or on your local laptop.

First, [create a new project](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/create-new-project#create-a-new-project) with the Dagster open-source CLI.

```shell
pip install dagster
dagster project from-example \
  --name my-dagster-project \
  --example assets_modern_data_stack
```

<Note>
  Once scaffolded, add <code>dagster-cloud</code> as a dependency in your{" "}
  <code>setup.py</code> file.
</Note>

Next, install the [dagster-cloud CLI](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/dagster-cloud-cli) and log in to your org. **Note**: The CLI requires a recent version of Python 3 and Docker.

```shell
pip install dagster-cloud
dagster-cloud configure
```

You can also configure the `dagster-cloud` tool noninteractively; see [the CLI docs](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/dagster-cloud-cli#environment-variables-and-cli-options) for more information.

Finally, deploy your project with Dagster Cloud Serverless:

```shell
dagster-cloud serverless deploy \
  --location-name example \
  --package-name assets_modern_data_stack
```

### Adding secrets

Often you'll need to securely access secrets from your jobs. With Dagster Cloud Serverless, secrets are added as environment variables that can be read using APIs like [StringSource](/guides/dagster/transitioning-data-pipelines-from-development-to-production#part-two-deployment).

- If you're using our GitHub integration, you can pass in secrets as a JSON string input to the serverless deploy step in your repository's Github action script.
- If you're using the CLI directly, you can pass `KEY=VALUE` pairs using the `--env` flag. Run `dagster-cloud serverless deploy --help` to learn more.

### Adding dependencies

Any dependencies specified in either `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` will be installed for you automatically by the Dagster Cloud Serverless infrastructure.

---

## Customizing the image

Many apps will work fine with the default Dagster Cloud Serverless setup. However, apps of a certain complexity may need to make changes to the base image, either to use a different OS, different Python version, or install some native dependencies. You can customize your image through our Serverless lifecycle hooks, and/or changing the base image.

### Lifecycle hooks

In the root of your repo, you can provide two optional shell scripts: `dagster_cloud_pre_install.sh` and `dagster_cloud_post_install.sh`. These will run before and after Python dependencies are installed. They are useful for installing any non-Python dependencies or otherwise configuring your environment.

### Changing the base image

- **With GitHub**: you can provide a `base_image` input parameter to the "build and deploy" step in your GitHub Actions configuration (usually at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **With the CLI**: add the `--base-image` CLI argument to the `dagster-cloud serverless deploy` command to specify the registry path to the desired base image.

---

## Transitioning to Hybrid

If your organization begins to hit the limitations of Serverless, you should transition to a Hybrid deployment. Hybrid deployments allow you to run an [agent in your own infrastructure](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents) and give you substantially more flexibility and control over the Dagster environment.

To switch to Hybrid, navigate to **Status > Agents** in your Dagster Cloud account. On this page, you can disable the Serverless agent on and view instructions for enabling Hybrid.

## Security and data protection

Unlike Hybrid, Serverless Deployments on Dagster Cloud require direct access to your data, secrets and source code.

- Dagster Cloud Serverless does not provide persistent storage. Ephemeral storage is deleted when a run concludes.
- Secrets and source code are built into the image directly. Images are stored in a per-customer container registry with restricted access.
- User code is securely sandboxed using modern container sandboxing techniques.
- All production access is governed by industry-standard best practices which are regularly audited.
